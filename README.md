#GIPHY

## Summary

The GIPHY app is a fun app where the user can populate gifs using the GIPHY API (by making an AJAX call to the GIPHY API), and using jQuery to dynamically render the HTML.

In the form on the righthand side of the app, the user will enter in the city of their choice next to "Add a city:" and click on submit.  The city entered in will then get added to the already preloaded buttons at the top of the app, and 10 gifs randomly generated from GIPHY will populate.

The 10 gifs are frozen once they are displayed, but the user can click on each gif to unfreeze them and click them again to freeze again.
